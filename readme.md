## Description

The purpose of this application is to use the Inquirer package with Node to create a user-generated readme file based on the user's input in the terminal.

## How To Use

Below is an overview of how to use this application:

* Install inquirer and fs through the terminal by running: npm i
* Open terminal on your desktop, cd into the directory, and run: node index.js
* Answers the questions that are prompted in your terminal, and see that a generated-readme.md file has been created in your directory with your inputs.

## More Info

You can watch a video demonstration of me running the app [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uH9FdJJJok). A sample generated readme can be found in the /util folder in the repo.
